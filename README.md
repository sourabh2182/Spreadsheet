The Spreadsheet class uses a HashMap to store cell values, with cell IDs in the format of [column][row]. The setCellValue method takes a cell ID and a formula, which can be a numeric value or a SUM formula in the format of SUM(A1:A3) or = A1+A2, where A1 and A3 are cell IDs for the start and end of a range to be summed. If the formula is a SUM or = operator, the evaluateFormula method is called to calculate the sum of the specified range, which is then stored as the cell value.

The getCellValue method retrieves the value of a cell by cell ID, returning 0 if the cell is empty or does not exist.

The isValidCellId method uses regular expressions to validate cell IDs, checking that they are in the correct format of a capital letter followed by one or more digits.

The isNumeric method checks if a given string can be parsed as an integer, returning true if it can and false otherwise.
